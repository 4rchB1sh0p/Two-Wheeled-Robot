# Two wheeled self balancing robot

A two-wheeled self-balancing robot, PID control architecture. Four PID controllers are implemented to control the position, velocity, rotation (measured using Quadrature Encoders) and the tilt angle of the robot. 

## Description of 4 Tasks 
1. Driving as fast as possible a distance of 3m.
2. Similar to 1. But additionally a 360Â° turn at about 1m and 2m travelled.
3. During balancing an additional weight is added and the robot compensate it (stay/return).
4. Driving a figure 8 by combining two circles with 1m diameter each.
